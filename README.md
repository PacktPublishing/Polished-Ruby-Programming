This is the code repository for [Polished Ruby Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/polished-ruby-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801072724), published by Packt.

**Build better software with more intuitive, maintainable, scalable, and high-performance Ruby code**

## What is this book about?
The most successful apps become more difficult to maintain over time as the codebase increases in size. Often, the source code reaches a point where a rewrite is required because the application can no longer be effectively maintained. Ruby allows you to enjoy programming by making it as simple as possible to build maintainable and scalable apps. Polished Ruby Programming provides you with recommendations and advice for designing Ruby programs that are easy to maintain in the long-term. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Use Ruby's core classes and design custom classes effectively
* Explore the principles behind variable usage and method argument choice
* Implement advanced error handling approaches such as exponential backoff
* Design extensible libraries and plugin systems in Ruby
* Use metaprogramming and DSLs to avoid code redundancy
* Implement different approaches to testing and understand their trade-offs
* Discover design patterns, refactoring, and optimization with Ruby
* Explore database design principles and advanced web app security

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Foo
  def self.bar
    :baz
  end
end
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you already know how to program in Ruby and want to learn more about the principles and best practices behind writing maintainable, scalable, optimized, and well-structured Ruby code, then this Ruby book is for you. Intermediate to advanced-level working knowledge of the Ruby programming language is expected to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-17).

| 1-17 | Ruby 3.0 | Any OS that runs Ruby |

### Errata

* Page 34: The sentence "If the method starts with the double underscore and is not already defined, someone is trying to override the aliased methods, so you can overwrite the aliased method by aliasing the original method again:" must be read as "If the method that was added starts with the double underscore, and the related method without the double underscore is already defined, someone is trying to override the aliased methods, so you can overwrite the aliased method by aliasing the original method again:" 

* Page 34: The sentence "If the method doesn't start with the double underscore and is already defined, you can fix the issue by aliasing the aliased method back to the original method:" can also be read as "If the method that was added doesn't start with the double underscore, and the related method with the double underscore is already defined, you can fix the issue by aliasing the aliased method back to the original method:"
